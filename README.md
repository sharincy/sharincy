      I'll be posting cool stuffs about fundamental of Python that I wrote.
      Get started with print and variables.
      A variable is created when you first assign a value to it.

     One of the most basic thing that every starters must face, including me.
     Observe the "#this type is int". The sharp states that those are comments just to read. This is the output when I run it.

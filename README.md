      I'll be posting cool stuffs about fundamental of Python that I wrote.
    ## Get started with print and variables
     A variable is created when you first assign a value to it.

     >One of the most basic thing that every starters must face, including me.
     Observe the __"#this type is int".__ The sharp states that those are comments just to read. This is the output when I run it.
     
     This is examples of multiple value

    ## This is my own discord bot

   Disclaimer. Yeah I know, it is pretty scary. I myself didn't understand all of them but I do know what the line does. 
   line number three for example. The prefix for the bot is __"c!"__.
   The 9th line indicating that if I type __"c!meow".__ The bot would responds back with line 11th __"Meow".__
   
   >It was genuinely fun, I smiled while I am creating it. This experience helped me understand the structure of how things work :)

   ## Graph created with Python
 
 ![matplotlib](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101504356/161306495-a8982bbd-8277-4c30-881f-5c9bb5ae06e3.PNG)![graph gaming](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101504356/161312505-a8dda279-a035-4e0d-b3bb-a03a1067996d.PNG)

  Now it is a bit advance moving to graphs. In this case I'm using matplotlib.pyplot to generate them but it is pretty long so I shortened them by using _import ... as_.
